# Content Approval Settings

When working with Umbraco Workflow, you can handle the content approval settings directly in the Backoffice from the **Settings** section. 

* [General settings](#general-settings)
* [New node approval flow](#new-node-approval-flow)
* [Document Type approval flows](#document-type-approval-flows)
* [Exclude nodes](#exclude-nodes)
* [Notification Settings](#notifications-settings)
* [Email templates](#email-templates)

![Workflow settings](../.gitbook/assets/workflow-settings-v14.png)

## General Settings

You can configure the **General** Settings from the **Content Approvals** menu in the **Settings** section. The following settings are available:

![General settings](../.gitbook/assets/workflow-settings-v14.png)

* **Flow type** - Determines the approval flow progress. These options manage how the Change Author is included in the workflow:
  * **Explicit** - All steps of the workflow must be completed, and all users will be notified of tasks (including the Change Author).
  * **Implicit** - All steps where the original Change Author is _not_ a member of the group must be completed. Steps where the original Change Author is a member of the approving group will be completed automatically and noted in the workflow history as not required.
  * **Exclude** - Similar to Explicit. All steps must be completed, but the original Change Author is not included in the notifications or shown in the dashboard tasks.
* **Approval threshold** - Sets the global approval threshold to One, Most, or All:
  * **One** - Pending task requires approval from any member of the assigned approval group. This is the default behavior for all installations (trial and licensed).
  * **Most** - Pending task requires an absolute majority of group members. For example, a group with three members requires two approvals, and a group with four members requires three approvals.
  * **All** - Pending task requires approval from all group members.
* **Rejection resets approvals** - When true, and the approval threshold is Most or All, rejecting a task resets the previous approvals for the workflow stage.
* **Allow configuring approval threshold** - Enables setting the approval threshold for any stage of a workflow (on a content node or Document Type).
* **Lock active content** - Determines how the content in a workflow should be managed. Set to `true` or `false` depending on whether the approval group responsible for the active workflow step should make modifications to the content. Content is locked after the first approval in the workflow - until then, the content can be edited as normal.
* **Administrators can edit** - Set to true to allow administrators to edit content at any stage of the workflow, ensuring flexibility and control over the content approval process.
* **Mandatory comments** - Set to true to require comments when approving workflows. Comments are always required when submitting changes for approval, and are always optional for admin users.
* **Allow attachments** - Provide an attachment (such as a supporting document or enable referencing a media item) when initiating a workflow. This feature is useful when a workflow requires supporting documentation.
* **Allow scheduling** - Provides an option to select a scheduled date when initiating a workflow.
* **Use workflow for unpublish** - Determines if unpublish actions require workflow approval. Set to true to display the **Action** option when submitting the content for approval.
* **Extend permissions** - Determines if Umbraco Workflow should extend or replace the users' save and publish permissions. The default behavior is to replace the users' permissions.
* **Require publish for initiate** - Determines the minimum user permission for initiating a workflow process. The default (false) behaviour requires the user have permission to update the entity. When true, the user must have permission to publish the entity to be able to submit for workflow approval. This setting was added in 17.3.4, defaulting to the legacy behaviour (requiring update permission only).

### New Node Approval Flow

## Notifications Settings

Umbraco Workflow uses Notifications to allow you to configure email notifications for all workflow activities for the backoffice.

From the **Content Approvals** view in the **Settings** section, the **Notifications** tab provides access to the following:

* **Send notifications:** If you wish to send email notifications to approval groups, you can enable it here. If your users are active in the backoffice, email notifications might not be required.
* **Workflow email:** Provide a sender address for email notifications. This is a mandatory field.
* **Reminder delay (days):** Set a delay in days for sending reminder emails for outstanding workflow processes. Set to 0 to disable reminder emails.
* **Edit site URL:** The URL for the editing environment (including schema - http\[s]). This is a mandatory field.
* **Site URL:** The URL for the public website (including schema - http\[s]). This is a mandatory field.
* [**Email templates**](#email-templates)**:** Configure which users receive emails for which workflow actions and modify the templates for those emails.

![Notifications tab in the Workflow Section](../.gitbook/assets/Notifications-tab-v14.png)

## Notifications Overview

Notification emails use HTML templates, which render information from the `HtmlEmailModel` type, which lives in the `Umbraco.Workflow.Core.Email.Models` namespace. While it is possible to modify the email templates from the backoffice, we recommend making changes via an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.

The `HtmlEmailModel` contains the following fields:

| Fields        | Data Type                 | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WorkflowType  | WorkflowType              | An `enum` value containing either 1 or 2 for Publish and Unpublish, respectively.                                  |
| ScheduledDate | DateTime                  | If a scheduled date exists for the workflow, it is found here.                                                    |
| Summary       | IHtmlString               | A pre-generated representation of the current workflow state.                                                     |
| CurrentTask   | WorkflowTaskViewModel     | The view model data for the current workflow task. Contains a lot of useful data, best explored via Intellisense. |
| Instance      | WorkflowInstanceViewModel | The view model data for the current workflow. Best explored via Intellisense.                                     |

The `HtmlEmailBase` contains the following fields:

| Fields       | Data Type      | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SiteUrl      | string         | The public URL of your site.                                                                         |
| NodeName     | string         | The name of the node from the current workflow.                                                      |
| Type         | string         | The workflow type, including the scheduled date (if exists).                                          |
| EmailType    | EmailType      | An `enum` value representing the current email type that relates directly to the workflow task type. |
| To           | EmailUserModel | The model defining the receiver of the email.                                                        |
| Email        | string         | The user's email address or a group address (if a group email is being sent).                        |
| Name         | Name           | The user's name.                                                                                     |
| Language     | string         | The user's language.                                                                                 |
| Id           | int            | The user's ID or group ID (when sending to a group email address).                                   |
| IsGroupEmail | bool           | Is the email being sent to a generic group email address?                                            |

Umbraco Workflow provides **Settings** for determining who receives emails at which stages of a workflow. While these are set to default values during installation, it is recommended to update your Notifications Settings to better suit your installation needs. Emails can be sent to:

* **All**: All the participants in all workflow stages (previous and current).
* **Admin**: The admin user.
* **Author**: The user who initiated the workflow.
* **Group**: All members of the group assigned to the current task.

{% hint style="info" %}
Duplicate users are removed from email notifications.
{% endhint %}

By default, all emails are sent to the **Group**. This might not always be an ideal situation. For example, cancelled workflows would be best sent to the **Author** only, likewise with rejected.

It might be useful to notify **All** the participants of completed workflows, but even this may be excessive. Depending on your website, you can adjust the best configuration.

## Reminders Overview

Umbraco Workflow uses a reminder email system to prompt editors to complete the pending workflows. Reminders are sent using Umbraco's internal task scheduler, every 24 hours after an initial delay. For example, setting the **Reminder delay (days)** value to 2 in the Workflow **Settings** section will allow pending workflows to sit for 2 days. After that, reminder emails will be sent every 24 hours to all members of the group assigned to the pending workflow task.

The emails use a similar model to the notification emails, also inheriting from `HtmlEmailBase`. In addition to the inherited fields, `HtmlReminderEmailModel` includes:

| Fields       | Data Type | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OverdueTasks | IList     | A list containing all the overdue tasks assigned to the current user. |
| TaskCount    | int       | The count of overdue tasks assigned to the current user.              |

## Email Templates

Umbraco Workflow ships the following email templates. They are compiled into the Workflow package, so emails render without any template files on disk.

| Template                                  | Email                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ApprovalRequest.cshtml`                  | Workflow approval request                     |
| `ApprovalRejection.cshtml`                | Workflow approval rejected                    |
| `ApprovedAndCompleted.cshtml`             | Workflow approved and completed               |
| `ApprovedAndCompletedForScheduler.cshtml` | Workflow approved and completed for scheduler |
| `WorkflowCancelled.cshtml`                | Workflow cancelled                            |
| `WorkflowErrored.cshtml`                  | Workflow error                                |
| `Reminder.cshtml`                         | Workflow overdue reminder                     |
| `ContentReview.cshtml`                    | Content review reminder                       |

To get a copy of the templates to customize, go to **Content Approvals** > **Notifications** in the **Settings** section and select **Install email templates**. Workflow copies the templates to `~/Views/Partials/workflow/email/`. The option is not available in `Production` mode, and is hidden once all the templates are on disk. Keep the file names unchanged: Workflow finds each template by its name.

Text in the templates is localized when the email is rendered, in the recipient's language, using `@Model.Localize("key")`. One template serves every language.

## Customizing an Email Template

Razor templates must be compiled before they can render. The shipped templates are compiled into the Workflow package, and your copy replaces one only if something compiles it. Which copy is used depends on the site's runtime mode:

| Runtime mode                  | Your copy is used when                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BackofficeDevelopment`       | The file on disk differs from the shipped template. Changes apply without restarting the site. Requires Umbraco Workflow 17.5.2 or later and the `Umbraco.Cms.DevelopmentMode.Backoffice` package. |
| `Development` or `Production` | The template was part of your project when the site was built.                                                                                                                                    |

{% hint style="warning" %}
In `Development` and `Production` mode, editing a template on the server, including through the backoffice, has no effect. The change applies only once it is part of a build.
{% endhint %}

### Deploying Customized Templates to Production

`Production` mode compiles views only at build and publish time, so customized templates must be part of the build.

1. In your local environment, select **Install email templates** to copy the templates to `~/Views/Partials/workflow/email/`.
2. Edit the templates you want to change.
3. Add only the templates you changed to source control. Every template in your project is compiled into your site and replaces the shipped version, including a copy you have not changed. That copy is only brought up to date when you run the update from the Email Templates health check.
4. Make sure views are compiled at build time by removing the following properties from your `.csproj` file:

    ```xml
    <RazorCompileOnBuild>false</RazorCompileOnBuild>
    <RazorCompileOnPublish>false</RazorCompileOnPublish>
    ```

    This is already required for `Production` mode, and is not compatible with the `InMemoryAuto` Models Builder mode. For more information, see the [Runtime Modes](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/run-in-production/runtime-modes) article.
5. Build, publish, and deploy the site.

To confirm which templates are in use, go to **Settings** > **Health Check** > **Workflow** > **Email Templates**. The check lists customized templates and reports whether each one is the version being rendered.

{% hint style="info" %}
Upgrading Workflow does not update the templates on disk. After upgrading, go to **Settings** > **Health Check** > **Workflow** > **Email Templates**. If it reports templates from an earlier release, select **Update email templates** to replace them with the current versions. The update is not available in `Production` mode.

Workflow never overwrites a customized template. To update one, delete your copy locally and select **Install email templates** to get the current version. Then reapply your changes.
{% endhint %}

### Culture-Specific Templates

Templates named with a culture suffix, such as `ApprovalRequest_da-DK.cshtml`, are still used for recipients whose language differs from the site's default language. Since templates are now localized at render time, they are no longer needed, and they do not receive translation updates. Remove them unless the wording must differ from the translation.

## Sample Email Template

Below is an excerpt of the shipped `ApprovalRequest.cshtml` template:

```csharp
@model Umbraco.Workflow.Core.Email.Models.HtmlEmailModel
@addTagHelper *, Umbraco.Workflow.Core

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="@Model.To.Language">
<head>
    @* the title is used as the email subject line *@
    <uw-head title="@Model.Localize("emailApprovalRequestSubject")"></uw-head>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>@Model.Localize("emailGreeting", Model.To.Name)</p>
        <p>@Model.Localize("emailApprovalRequestIntro", Model.Type.ToLower())</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="@(Model.CurrentTask?.BackofficeUrl)">@(Model.CurrentTask?.Node?.Name)</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        @* approval buttons omitted - see the full template *@

        @Model.Summary
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
