## Step 2: API Keys

In order for Umbraco Commerce to communicate with Mollie securely we need to retrieve a series of API keys used for authentication.

1. Access the [Mollie Portal](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/login).
2. Click the **Developers** heading.
3. Choose the **API keys** subheading.

On the right-hand side, you will find your **Live API key** and your **Test API key** displayed. Note these down as you will need to enter them into the Umbraco Commerce UI shortly.

2. Choose the **Website profiles** subheading.
