description: Getting Started with the Zero payment provider for Umbraco Commerce.
---

# Overview

The Zero payment provider is a payment option that processes transactions without any actual monetary exchange. It facilitates order completion without monetary transactions in scenarios like testing, development, promotions, and giveaways.

Before you begin, ensure that you have an Umbraco website set up and Umbraco Commerce installed. If not, see the [Umbraco Commerce Documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce/) to get started.

## Install Zero

By default, Umbraco Commerce includes the Zero payment provider. If the package has been removed from your implementation, see the [Installing Umbraco Commerce](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce/getting-started/install) article to reinstall it again.
